        <h1 class="section-title" style="margin-top:6mm;">1 Introduction</h1>
        <p class="no-indent">An inguinal hernia occurs when abdominal contents, most commonly part of the intestine, protrude through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, located in the lower abdominal wall [1]. Inguinal hernias are the most prevalent type of hernia, particularly in men, accounting for approximately 75% of all abdominal wall hernias. The lifetime risk of developing an inguinal hernia is estimated to be around 27% in men and 3% in women [2], with the incidence increasing with age [3]. Although inguinal hernias affect individuals across all age groups, they are most frequently observed in elderly men due to age-related weakening of the abdominal muscles [4]. Surgical repair remains the cornerstone of treatment [5], as inguinal hernias do not resolve spontaneously and can lead to serious complications, such as incarceration or strangulation [6]. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, there remain significant challenges, including the risks of hernia recurrence, chronic pain, and mesh-related complications [7]. Consequently, there is a pressing need to explore and develop novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

    <div class="page-content two-column">
        <p class="no-indent" style="margin-top:0;">The pathogenesis of inguinal hernia remains unclear, but bioinformatics and text mining approaches offer valuable tools to explore its underlying mechanisms. Bioinformatics research spans several fields, including genomic analysis, image analysis, ontology, and database applications, all of which can be utilized to investigate disease pathogenesis [8, 9]. For example, in a transgenic male mouse model, Serdar and colleagues demonstrated the critical role of estrogen and its nuclear receptor in promoting fibroblast proliferation and muscle atrophy, which are processes that may contribute to the development of inguinal hernia [10]. Additionally, using bioinformatics methods in an inguinal hernia mouse model, we identified several potential gene targets, including Cmya1, Cmya5, Ttn, Actc1, Casq2, and Csrp3, along with the associated drug dexamethasone [11]. Other studies have also explored the application of text mining in non-cancer-related clinical research. For instance, Hu et al. identified key genes and pathways involved in scleral extracellular matrix remodeling in glaucoma through text mining analysis [12]. Similarly, Sun and colleagues used text mining methods to explore essential genes and drug interactions in breast cancer and periodontitis [13]. However, there are currently no studies that integrate text mining and bioinformatics approaches specifically for the investigation of inguinal hernia.</p>
        <p>This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of inguinal hernia using bioinformatics and text mining approaches. Various bioinformatics tools and databases were utilized to identify potential gene targets and drug interactions related to inguinal hernia. Text mining genes (TMGs) were extracted by querying the GENCLIP3 database using the keyword &ldquo;inguinal hernia.&rdquo; Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out using FunRich software. Protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) were constructed, and gene clusters were identified using the MCODE algorithm within the Cytoscape platform. Additionally, drug-gene interactions were explored through the DGIDB database to identify drugs targeting the genes within these clusters. This study will provide new insights for the treatment of inguinal hernia.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">2 Methods and Materials</h1>
        <h2 class="subsection-title">2.1 Text Mining Genes (TMGs) Acquisition</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">GENCLIP3 is an interactive platform designed for mining human genes, their functions, and regulatory networks from the PubMed database, using co-occurrence analysis and natural language processing (http://ci.smu.edu.cn/genclip3/analysis.php) [14]. We entered the keyword &ldquo;inguinal hernia&rdquo; into the search box under the &ldquo;Function Related Gene and Gene Network&rdquo; section, which generated a list of genes associated with the term &ldquo;inguinal hernia.&rdquo; All identified genes were then selected and saved in gene symbol format for subsequent analyses.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">2.2 Gene Ontology and Biological Pathway Enrichment Analyses</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Gene Ontology (GO) and biological pathway enrichment analyses are crucial for understanding gene functions and their involvement in various biological processes. FunRich version 3.1 is a versatile tool that integrates multiple databases, including FunRich (Human only), UniProt, Gene Ontology, and Reactome, to facilitate these analyses. For the GO analysis, we uploaded the TMGs dataset into FunRich 3.1, selected the &ldquo;Gene Ontology database,&rdquo; and proceeded with the &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; function to obtain results for biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF). Similarly, for pathway enrichment analysis, we switched the reference database to &ldquo;FunRich&rdquo; and followed the same steps. Default settings were used for all parameters, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">2.3 Protein and Protein Interaction Networks Construction and Gene Module Selection</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">By leveraging the concept that genes encode proteins and constructing protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs), we can explore the relationships among genes. We first used the STRING database (https://string-db.org/) to build PPINs, incorporating seven interaction types: text mining, experimental evidence, curated databases, co-expression, neighborhood proximity, gene fusion, and co-occurrence. The MCODE plugin in Cytoscape was then employed to cluster the densely connected nodes.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">2.4 Potential Drugs Selection and Signal Pathway Analyses</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Since the development of many drugs relies on interactions between drugs and gene targets, our goal was to identify drugs that correspond to the TMGs through an open-access database. The DGIdb database (https://dgidb.org/search_interactions) fulfills this need, as it integrates multiple trusted sources to evaluate gene-drug interactions and uncover potential therapeutic options for inguinal hernia. We first uploaded the TMGs from the gene module into the search function of DGIdb to identify existing drugs or molecules. Subsequently, we selected the TMGs with associated drugs and performed pathway analysis using the DAVID database. During this process, drugs without defined interaction types with genes were excluded. Ultimately, we retained only those drugs with clear interaction types, such as antibody, inhibitor, agonist, binder, blocker, and antagonist.</p>
        <h2 class="subsection-title">2.5 Statistical Analysis</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used to determine the statistical significance of the enrichment results for GO terms and biological pathways. All statistical analyses were performed using appropriate software tools, and results with p-values below the threshold of 0.05 were considered statistically significant, indicating meaningful biological insights.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">2.6 Research Ethics</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">We just re-analyzed the data from the open and public datasets, so the ethical approval for human and animal subjects is not needed.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">3 Results</h1>
        <h2 class="subsection-title">3.1 The TMGs Acquisition</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Through text mining retrieving in GENCLIP3, ninety-nine human TMGs have been obtained (Table 1, the result generation time is July 2021) for further analyses.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title" style="margin-top:0;">3.2 GO and Pathway Enrichment Analyses</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">To gain insights into the characteristics of the TMGs, we conducted GO and biological pathway enrichment analyses. The results are presented in Figure 1A&ndash;D. For BP, the three most significantly enriched terms were the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway (p &lt; 0.001), negative regulation of apoptotic processes (p &lt; 0.001), and positive regulation of cell proliferation (p &lt; 0.001). In terms of CC, the TMGs were predominantly associated with the extracellular region (p &lt; 0.001), extracellular space (p &lt; 0.001), and extracellular matrix (p &lt; 0.001). For MF, significant enrichment was found in endopeptidase activity (p &lt; 0.001), insulin receptor substrate binding (p = 0.001), and neurotrophin TRKA receptor binding (p = 0.012). Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the TMGs were significantly involved in the integrin-linked kinase signaling pathway (p &lt; 0.001), regulation of CDC42 activity (p &lt; 0.001), and the AP-1 transcription factor network (p &lt; 0.001).</p>

        </figure>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">3.3 PPINs Construction and Gene Module Selection</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">As illustrated in Figure 2A, 69 genes/nodes/proteins were involved in the PPINs, with a total of 270 edges. Among these, 25 genes displayed a high degree of connectivity, each being associated with more than 10 other genes, based on degree scores. The top 10 hub genes identified were VEGFA, HGF, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, MMP9, ALB, HSP90AA1, GRB2, and MMP2 (Table 2).</p>
        <p>Clustering analysis was performed to identify genes/nodes/proteins that were more densely connected within the PPINs, utilizing seven interaction types. The analysis revealed a significant gene module (module 1), comprising 22 genes, which included TIMP1, SAA1, POMC, TGFB1, MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, IL10, HGF, VEGFA, MET, PLCG1, CRK, PTPN11, CDC42, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3R1, SOS1, GRB2, CBL, and KRAS (Figure 2B).</p>
        <h2 class="subsection-title">3.4 Potential Drugs Selection and Signal Pathway Analyses</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">We identified 46 drugs or compounds that matched 14 gene targets using the DGIdb database. These drugs interact with the gene targets through various mechanisms, such as binding, agonism, and antibody interactions. In addition, GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed on the 14 candidate genes, yielding 20 significant KEGG signaling pathway terms. As shown in Figure 3, the Sankey plot illustrates the connections between the drugs, genes, and KEGG pathways. The top enriched KEGG pathways included Pancreatic cancer, Proteoglycans in cancer, Pathways in cancer, and Renal cell carcinoma. Notably, the top three pathways are all associated with cancer, suggesting a potential link between these gene targets and cancer-related mechanisms.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">4 Discussion</h1>
        <p class="no-indent">Inguinal hernia is a prevalent condition, particularly among older adults, with a significant impact on quality of life and healthcare systems. Despite its high incidence, the pathogenesis of inguinal hernia remains poorly understood, and current treatment modalities primarily rely on surgical interventions, which carry risks of recurrence, chronic pain, and mesh-related complications. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying inguinal hernia through a comprehensive bioinformatics and text mining approach, identifying potential gene targets and drug interactions that could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>
        <p>We identified 99 TMGs associated with inguinal hernia through the GENCLIP3 database. Subsequent GO and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that these genes are significantly involved in critical biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. At the cellular level, TMGs were predominantly associated with the extracellular region, extracellular space, and extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM refers to the complex network of proteins and polysaccharides that are found outside of cells in tissues [15]. It plays a crucial role in providing structural support, facilitating cell-to-cell communication, and influencing cellular behavior such as differentiation, migration, and proliferation [16]. Remodeling of the ECM may play a significant role in the development of abdominal wall hernias. During the formation of a hernia, the muscles and fascial layers of the abdominal wall can weaken or rupture, allowing internal organs to protrude [17]. This process may involve changes in the collagen and elastin within the ECM, as well as alterations in cell-to-cell communication. Disruptions in these components could lead to structural weaknesses that predispose individuals to hernia development.</p>

        <p>Molecular function enrichment pointed to endopeptidase activity, insulin receptor substrate binding, and neurotrophin TRKA receptor binding. These functions indicate that proteolytic processes and receptor-mediated signaling pathways are integral to the pathogenesis of inguinal hernia. Proteolytic enzymes [18], such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [19], are known to degrade ECM components, potentially leading to tissue weakening [20]. Receptor interactions, particularly those involving insulin signaling, may influence cellular metabolism and structural integrity. Insulin signal transduction primarily involves the regulation of blood glucose levels and metabolic processes [21], whereas hernias result from the protrusion of internal organs due to the weakness or rupture of the abdominal wall muscles and fascial layers [22]. However, it is worth noting that certain conditions, such as obesity, may increase the risk of developing hernias. Obesity can lead to increased abdominal wall pressure, thereby elevating the likelihood of hernia occurrence. Additionally, obesity is associated with insulin resistance, which could indirectly influence the development of hernias.</p>

        <p>Pathway enrichment analysis further identified the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling pathway, regulation of CDC42 activity, and the AP-1 transcription factor network as significantly involved in inguinal hernia. The ILK pathway is essential for cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization [23], while CDC42 is a key regulator of cell morphology and migration [24]. The AP-1 transcription factor network plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to various stimuli, including stress and cytokines [25]. These pathways collectively suggest that alterations in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and gene regulation are central to hernia pathogenesis.</p>

        <p>The construction of PPINs revealed a highly interconnected cluster of 22 genes, including key hub genes such as VEGFA, HGF, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, MMP9, and GRB2. These hub genes are involved in essential cellular processes like angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and ECM remodeling. For instance, VEGFA is critical for blood vessel formation [26], which may influence tissue repair and regeneration in the abdominal wall. MMP9, a matrix metalloproteinase [27], plays a direct role in ECM degradation, potentially leading to structural weaknesses.</p>

        <p>We identified 46 drugs or compounds that interact with 14 key gene targets through the DGIdb database. The identification of existing drugs that target these genes opens avenues for drug repurposing. For example, inhibitors targeting the EGFR pathway [28], commonly used in cancer therapy, might be explored for their potential to modulate similar pathways in inguinal hernia.</p>

        <p>The significant enrichment of cancer-related pathways among the identified gene targets is particularly intriguing. It suggests that inguinal hernia may share common molecular mechanisms with cancer, such as dysregulated cell growth, apoptosis, and ECM remodeling. This association aligns with one study that has reported an increased risk of certain cancers in patients with hernias [29]. A study has revealed no significant difference in the incidence of colon cancer between patients with inguinal hernias and those without [30]. We also found hernia might be associated with pancreatic cancer. The association between hernias and pancreatic cancer is an emerging and complex topic. While hernias and pancreatic cancer do not have a widely established direct causal relationship, there have been cases where hernias have played a role in revealing underlying pancreatic conditions or complications. One study reported the case of a rapidly growing pancreatic adenocarcinoma that presented as metastasis to an umbilical hernia sac, indicating that hernias can sometimes reveal metastatic pancreatic cancer [31]. There was also a rare case where a ductal adenocarcinoma arose from a heterotopic pancreas located in a hiatal hernia, showing that displaced pancreatic tissue in hernias could undergo malignant transformation [32]. In summary, while hernias do not directly cause pancreatic cancer, they can sometimes reveal or complicate underlying pancreatic malignancies. Understanding these shared pathways could lead to novel insights into both conditions, potentially uncovering targets that could be therapeutically exploited to treat or prevent inguinal hernia.</p>

        <p>However, the study is not without limitations. The reliance on existing databases means that the results are contingent upon the quality and completeness of the data available. Additionally, bioinformatics predictions require experimental validation to confirm their biological relevance and therapeutic potential. The identified drug-gene interactions, while promising, need to be tested in clinical settings to assess their efficacy and safety in treating inguinal hernia.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">5 Conclusion</h1>
        <p class="no-indent">This study advances our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of inguinal hernia by identifying key genes and pathways through bioinformatics and text mining approaches. The discovery of drug-gene interactions, particularly those overlapping with cancer-related pathways, offers promising avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. These findings not only shed light on the complex biology of inguinal hernia but also pave the way for future research aimed at improving treatment outcomes for this common and impactful condition.</p>
